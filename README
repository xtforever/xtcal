Simply type "make" to build, or "make debug=1" to get additional info.
To rebuild the Calib widget you'll need wbuild.

Start with "xtcalib" and you get the "coordinate transformation matrix" on stdout.
use xinput to apply the matrix:
xinput set-prop 'my touch' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' a b c d e f g h i

xtcalib will try to go fullscreen, if this doesn't work you need to run with:
xtcalib -geometry <Width>x<Height>


xinput list
xinput list-props 10
xinput set-props 10 147    1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

xinput float format:   7.12345
